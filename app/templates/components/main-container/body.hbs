      I am delighted to welcome you all to the Sunrise Academy. We have an amazing brand new purpose built building which provides our children with an excellent place to learn and grow to face a fiercely competitive
      knowledge and skill driven global economy. We encourage our children to observe the world around and to express themselves in a variety of ways. We are very much conscious of the fact that emotional stability plays a very significant role in the healthy
      growth of the child, so our curriculum is based on an open and interactive approach. Because educators also need to learn.
